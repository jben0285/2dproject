# 2dproject

had trouble uploading the entire project because it was over 1gb, let me know if you want to see anything other than the scripts.

Overall, felt like I spent too much time making assets instead of coding (making the roll animations was painful). This led to me not being able to make a full dungeon and no variety in enemy type.

Other than that, I kept the simple 4 inputs so that it could possibly be used as a mobile game. Combat is easy and can be tuned for harder difficulties.

Enemies when stunned can be instakilled, however the player is also instantly killed to compensate for the zombie/orc's slow action time.
